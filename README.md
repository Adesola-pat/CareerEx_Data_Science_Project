# CareerEx_Data_Science_Project
This project is focused on developing a logistic regression model to predict the income level of a person, if it exceeds $50k/year or less than.  Logistic Regression is used as a classification algorithm that models the probability of a binary outcome.  
----
## OBJECTIVES
- Predict whether income > $50k using personal and professional attributes
- Apply logistics regression as a baseline classifier
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, Encoding Categorical Features, Scaling numerical features and removing outliers.
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
- Using confusion matrix to evaluate the predictive accuracy of the model.
- Generating other evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1 score and ROC-AUC was also generated in other to have a more detailed view of the model's performance.
